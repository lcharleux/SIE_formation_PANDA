Welcome to our modular training series for PhD students, focused on the essential digital tools every researcher should master. Whether you’re writing a thesis, analyzing data, or managing code, these hands‑on sessions help you build solid foundations — at your own pace.

We’ve designed a progressive and flexible path, so you can stop when you’ve covered what you need, or continue deeper if you want to expand your skills.
