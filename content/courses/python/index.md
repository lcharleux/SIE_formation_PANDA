You didn’t start a PhD to spend your days copying-pasting in Excel or manually renaming 200 files.

You started it to do science — and Python is the tool that lets you focus on thinking, not clicking.

In this hands-on tutorial, you’ll learn how Python can help you:

	•	📊 Crunch data without crying over spreadsheets
	•	🔁 Automate repetitive tasks so you can stop being your own intern
	•	🧪 Build clean, reproducible workflows for analysis, simulation, or visualization
	•	📦 Use the Python ecosystem: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, SciPy, and friends
	•	🧠 Organize your research code so it actually makes sense six months later
	•	🤖 Open the door to more advanced tools: machine learning, modeling, simulations…

No coding background? No problem.
We’ll start from zero and build up the skills every researcher wishes they’d learned earlier.

Python isn’t just for programmers — it’s the Swiss army knife of modern research.
Let’s make it your secret weapon.
