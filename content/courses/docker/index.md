Ever tried to re-run your code six months later and it just… doesn’t?
Or shared your scripts with a colleague and it instantly breaks on their system?

Welcome to the jungle of research environments.
Docker is your exit strategy.

In this tutorial, we’ll demystify Docker — not for DevOps pros, but for scientists who want to:

-	📦 Package your code and environment so it runs anywhere, the same way
-	🔁 Reproduce your own work (and others’) without dependency hell
-	🧪 Bundle Jupyter notebooks, scripts, tools, and data in clean containers
-	🚀 Share your projects with collaborators without painful setup guides
-	🧊 Freeze your environment for publication, thesis submission, or archiving
-	🧹 Keep your machine clean while testing new tools in isolated sandboxes

No need to be a sysadmin — we’ll start from scratch, show you why Docker is a game changer, and teach you how to use it for what matters: research that runs.

Docker: because your research deserves to outlive your laptop.
