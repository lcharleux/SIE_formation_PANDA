Writing your PhD isn’t just about the science — it’s about making it look clean, sharp, and professional, even when your supervisor sends you five rounds of conflicting comments.

Enter LaTeX: the typesetting language of science. It’s not just for mathematicians and masochists — it’s the tool that finally lets you:

-	🧼 Stop fighting formatting in Word
-	✍️ Write beautiful equations, figures, and citations without frustration
-	🧩 Split your monster manuscript into clean, modular files
-	🔁 Track versions and integrate seamlessly with Git
-	📬 Make revisions painless (even with multiple supervisors)
-	🎓 Output ready-to-submit PDFs for journals, conferences, and your thesis
-	🧠 Focus on your ideas — not on where that damn figure went

In this hands-on session, we’ll go from “what even is this code?” to “wow, I never want to touch Word again.”
We’ll cover the basics, teach you how to structure a real paper or thesis, and show how to keep your writing workflow smooth, stable, and scalable.

LaTeX isn’t a hurdle — it’s a superpower.
Let’s make your manuscript as smart as your research.
