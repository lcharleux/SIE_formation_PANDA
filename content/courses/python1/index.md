You didn’t start a PhD to spend your days copying-pasting in Excel or manually renaming 200 files. You started it to do science — and Python is the tool that lets you focus on thinking, not clicking.

What you’ll learn in Part 1 (Introduction):

- Core Python syntax: variables, types, and control flow
- Essential data structures: lists, dicts, sets, and arrays
- Working in notebooks and scripts (Jupyter vs. `.py`)
- Reading/writing files and simple automation
- Plotting basics with Matplotlib
- First steps with NumPy and pandas for data tasks

No coding background? No problem. We start from zero and build up the skills every researcher wishes they’d learned earlier.

Python isn’t just for programmers — it’s the Swiss army knife of modern research. Let’s make it your secret weapon.
