You’ve probably done this:

	•	manuscript_v2_FINAL.docx
	•	manuscript_v2_FINAL_revised_OK_THIS_ONE.tex
	•	manuscript_v2_FINAL_revised_OK_THIS_ONE_FOR_REAL_bis_bis.docx

… we’ve all been there.

It’s time to break up with folders full of confusing file versions and discover Git: the ultimate time machine, collaboration engine, and safety net for your research.

In this hands-on tutorial, you’ll learn:

	•	🗂️ How to track changes in your code, scripts, or manuscripts
	•	🧠 How to stop fearing overwrites or “breaking everything”
	•	🤝 How to collaborate without emailing ZIP files
	•	🛠️ How to use GitHub (and understand what a “pull request” actually is)
	•	🔍 How Git supports open, transparent, and reproducible research

No prior experience needed — if you can save a file, you can learn Git.
And once you do, you’ll wonder how you ever worked without it.

Let’s make version control your new best research habit.
